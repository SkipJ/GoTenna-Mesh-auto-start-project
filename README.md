Figuring a way to make GoTenna mesh units restart automatically after temporary loss of power

Working with the GoTenna Mesh Community at https://meshcommunity.gotenna.com/

I have tested the basic functionality for turning the GTM unit on and checking and trying again after a certain (programmable) duration.  And I have measured current usage with an aim to get it down as much as possible.

What I haven't done is deploy the thing in the wild for a long period under solar power to make sure it does what we want it to do in the long run.  Please post in the GTM Community if you gain further insight into these areas.
